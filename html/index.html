                <h2>Overview</h2>
                
                The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive database solution designed to improve the management of hospital operations, including patients, appointments, doctors, departments, and treatments. The hospital serves an average of 500 patients daily and employs over 50 doctors across multiple departments. Hospitals face significant operational challenges without an efficient data management system, such as double-booked appointments, delays in accessing patient records, inefficient doctor scheduling, and difficulty tracking treatments.
